        {{ male_name }} was a {{job_title}} who loved technology. Although she loved parts of her job, she absolutely hated  {{tedious_task}} and {{dirty_task}}. So, {{male_name}} met with her life mentor {{celebrity}} who told her to learn how to {{useless_skill}} with Thinkful. Thinkful didn't offer a course on {{useless_skill}} so she studied programming instead. 

        What a great decision! With her new skills, {{male_name}} built a(n) {{adjective}} robot named {{obnoxious_celebrity}} that         not only loved {{dirty_task}} but did it {{huge_number}} times faster.
